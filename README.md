## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if a desired location in Oahu, Hawaii for an icecream and surf shop called Surf n' Shake has ideal year-round weather conditions. We will analyze and review a dataset pertaining to the weather conditions of the area which has been stored in a SQLite database to provide critical and detailed information to convince an investor that opening up a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii is a good business idea. The business plan is for this shop to sell surf boards and ice cream throughout the year, however, the investor is a bit hesitant because of a prior investment that was a similar concept with poor weather conditions. In order to convince our investor, we need to provide him with a statistical analysis on the weather conditions in Oahu, Hawaii that depicts how the location has ideal weather conditions for a successful icecream and surf shop  and convince him that this will be a successful investment.

We will explore the data in the SQLite database. In order to review the data in depth we used SQLAlchemy to connect and generate queries to pull the necessary information needed for our analysis. Jupiter notebook was used to import dependencies and create the commands to pull the data from the SQLite database.
